  # unit tests for accounts_balance_get
  # Retrieve real-time balance data
  # The &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60; endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item&#39;s accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60; forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, &#x60;balance&#x60; itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link.

  # unit tests for accounts_get
  # Retrieve accounts
  # The &#x60;/accounts/get&#x60; endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of accounts associated with any linked Item. Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.  This endpoint only returns accounts that were permissioned by the user when they initially created the Item. If a user creates a new account after the initial link, you can capture this event through the [&#x60;NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/#item-new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link&#39;s [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.  This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use &#x60;/accounts/balance/get&#x60; instead. Note that some information is nullable.

  # unit tests for asset_report_audit_copy_create
  # Create Asset Report Audit Copy
  # Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.  To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/create&#x60; endpoint to create an &#x60;audit_copy_token&#x60; and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own &#x60;auditor_id&#x60;, for example &#x60;fannie_mae&#x60;. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

  # unit tests for asset_report_audit_copy_get
  # Retrieve an Asset Report Audit Copy
  # &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/get&#x60; allows auditors to get a copy of an Asset Report that was previously shared via the &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/create&#x60; endpoint.  The caller of &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/create&#x60; must provide the &#x60;audit_copy_token&#x60; to the auditor.  This token can then be used to call &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/create&#x60;.

  # unit tests for asset_report_audit_copy_remove
  # Remove Asset Report Audit Copy
  # The &#x60;/asset_report/audit_copy/remove&#x60; endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the &#x60;audit_copy_token&#x60; associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.

  # unit tests for asset_report_create
  # Create an Asset Report
  # The &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the &#x60;asset_report_token&#x60; return value to the &#x60;/asset_report/get&#x60; or &#x60;/asset_report/pdf/get&#x60; endpoints.  The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60;. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using &#x60;/asset_report/get&#x60; or &#x60;/asset_report/pdf/get&#x60;, Plaid will fire a &#x60;PRODUCT_READY&#x60; webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks/#assets-webhooks).  The &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the &#x60;/asset_report/refresh&#x60; endpoint.

  # unit tests for asset_report_filter
  # Filter Asset Report
  # By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the &#x60;/accounts/get&#x60; endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60; endpoint.  To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; endpoint to create the report, then send the &#x60;asset_report_token&#x60; along with a list of &#x60;account_ids&#x60; to exclude to the &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60; endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report&#39;s data.  Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60; does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60; creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60; do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.  Plaid will fire a [&#x60;PRODUCT_READY&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

  # unit tests for asset_report_get
  # Retrieve an Asset Report
  # The &#x60;/asset_report/get&#x60; endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling &#x60;/asset_report/get&#x60;, you must first create the Asset Report using &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; (or filter an Asset Report using &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60;) and then wait for the [&#x60;PRODUCT_READY&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.  By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.  To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the &#x60;/asset_report/get&#x60; endpoint with &#x60;include_insights&#x60; set to &#x60;true&#x60;.

  # unit tests for asset_report_pdf_get
  # Retrieve a PDF Asset Report
  # The &#x60;/asset_report/pdf/get&#x60; endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling &#x60;/asset_report/pdf/get&#x60;, you must first create the Asset Report using &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; (or filter an Asset Report using &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60;) and then wait for the [&#x60;PRODUCT_READY&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.  The response to &#x60;/asset_report/pdf/get&#x60; is the PDF binary data. The &#x60;request_id&#x60;  is returned in the &#x60;Plaid-Request-ID&#x60; header.

  # unit tests for asset_report_refresh
  # Refresh an Asset Report
  # An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user&#39;s assets. In order to \&quot;refresh\&quot; an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the &#x60;/asset_report/refresh&#x60; endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.  The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to &#x60;/asset_report/filter&#x60;. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original &#x60;/asset_report/create&#x60; request, but the original &#x60;days_requested&#x60; value and the values of any parameters in the &#x60;options&#x60; object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to &#x60;/asset_report/refresh&#x60;. Submit an empty string (\&quot;\&quot;) for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

  # unit tests for asset_report_remove
  # Delete an Asset Report
  # The &#x60;/item/remove&#x60; endpoint allows you to invalidate an &#x60;access_token&#x60;, meaning you will not be able to create new Asset Reports with it. Removing an Item does not affect any Asset Reports or Audit Copies you have already created, which will remain accessible until you remove them specifically.  The &#x60;/asset_report/remove&#x60; endpoint allows you to remove an Asset Report. Removing an Asset Report invalidates its &#x60;asset_report_token&#x60;, meaning you will no longer be able to use it to access Report data or create new Audit Copies. Removing an Asset Report does not affect the underlying Items, but does invalidate any &#x60;audit_copy_tokens&#x60; associated with the Asset Report.

  # unit tests for auth_get
  # Retrieve auth data
  # The &#x60;/auth/get&#x60; endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification numbers (such as routing numbers, for US accounts) associated with an Item&#39;s checking and savings accounts, along with high-level account data and balances when available.  Note: This request may take some time to complete if &#x60;auth&#x60; was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.  Also note that &#x60;/auth/get&#x60; will not return data for any new accounts opened after the Item was created. To obtain data for new accounts, create a new Item.  Versioning note: In API version 2017-03-08, the schema of the &#x60;numbers&#x60; object returned by this endpoint is substantially different. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2018-05-22).

  # Use the &#x60;/bank_transfer/balance/get&#x60; endpoint to see the available balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.  The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.  Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration.

You can use this endpoint to look up a user&#39;s employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.  The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.

Instead, use &#x60;/link/token/create&#x60; with an &#x60;access_token&#x60; to create a Link token for use with [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).  If you need your user to take action to restore or resolve an error associated with an Item, generate a public token with the &#x60;/item/public_token/create&#x60; endpoint and then initialize Link with that &#x60;public_token&#x60;.  A &#x60;public_token&#x60; is one-time use and expires after 30 minutes. You use a &#x60;public_token&#x60; to initialize Link in [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) for a particular Item. You can generate a &#x60;public_token&#x60; for an Item even if you did not use Link to create the Item originally.

  # unit tests for payment_initiation_payment_create
  # Create a payment
  # After creating a payment recipient, you can use the &#x60;/payment_initiation/payment/create&#x60; endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.  Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.  In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR. For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

  # unit tests for transactions_get
  # Get transaction data
  # The &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60; endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype &#x60;student&#x60;; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products#investments) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.  Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60;.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).  Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the &#x60;count&#x60; and &#x60;offset&#x60; parameters in conjunction with the &#x60;total_transactions&#x60; response body field to fetch all available transactions.  Data returned by &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60; will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item&#39;s &#x60;status.transactions.last_successful_update&#x60; field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the &#x60;/transactions/refresh&#x60; endpoint.  Note that data may not be immediately available to &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60;. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with &#x60;transactions&#x60;, or upon the first call to &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60;, if it wasn&#39;t. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [&#x60;INITIAL_UPDATE&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-initial_update) and [&#x60;HISTORICAL_UPDATE&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when &#x60;/transactions/get&#x60; is called, it will return a &#x60;PRODUCT_NOT_READY&#x60; error.

If changes to transactions are discovered after calling &#x60;/transactions/refresh&#x60;, Plaid will fire a webhook: [&#x60;TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#deleted-transactions-detected) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [&#x60;DEFAULT_UPDATE&#x60;](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks#transactions-default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected.

See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.    - To permit a transfer with the rationale code &#x60;MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM&#x60;, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).    - To permit a transfer with the rationale code &#x60;LOGIN_REQUIRED&#x60;, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).  All username/password combinations other than the ones listed above will result in a decision of permitted and rationale code &#x60;ERROR&#x60;.
