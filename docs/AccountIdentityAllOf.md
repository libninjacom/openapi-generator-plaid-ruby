# OpenapiClient::AccountIdentityAllOf

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **owners** | [**Array&lt;Owner&gt;**](Owner.md) | Data returned by the financial institution about the account owner or owners. Only returned by Identity or Assets endpoints. For business accounts, the name reported may be either the name of the individual or the name of the business, depending on the institution. Multiple owners on a single account will be represented in the same &#x60;owner&#x60; object, not in multiple owner objects within the array. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the &#x60;owners&#x60; object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level &#x60;identity&#x60; object. For more details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29) |  |

## Example

```ruby
require 'openapi_client'

instance = OpenapiClient::AccountIdentityAllOf.new(
  owners: null
)
```
